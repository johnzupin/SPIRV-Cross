Description: A tool for cross-compiling SPIR-V to other shader formats
 SPIRV-Cross is a tool designed for parsing and converting SPIR-V to other
 shader languages.
 .
 FEATURES:
 - Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient GLSL
 - Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient Metal Shading Language (MSL) [EXPERIMENTAL]
 - Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient HLSL [EXPERIMENTAL]
 - Convert SPIR-V to debuggable C++ [EXPERIMENTAL]
 - Reflection API to simplify the creation of Vulkan pipeline layouts
 - Reflection API to modify and tweak OpDecorations
 - Supports "all" of vertex, fragment, tessellation, geometry and compute shaders.
